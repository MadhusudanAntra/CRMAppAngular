modules are the basic block in angular. 
Angular application will look for modules to call the components in angular
default module in angular is appModule...
to create a module we need to use a decorator called @NgModule({})
to change the default landing module go to main.ts file and change the default bootstrap module


@NgModule decorator has following important properties

   declarations:- it is an array where you can define the components related to the module
   imports :- it is an array where you can define the other modules used in this module
   providers:- it is an array where you can inject the services to the modules
   bootstrap:- it tells that which component will automatically called when the module will load
